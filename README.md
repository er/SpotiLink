## SpotiLink
SpotiLink is a program written in Python to automatically link lots of Spotify accounts to your Discord.

You will need to have Google Chrome installed before running the program, alongside Python and Pip.

Download the files
Enter all your Spotify accounts into `accounts.txt` in the format `email@gmail.com:password321`
Open command prompt in the folder
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`python main.py`

Little testing was done when writing this so there will likely be lots of bugs.

This IS against Discord's TOS and MAY result in your account being terminated.
